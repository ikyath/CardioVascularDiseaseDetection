# CardioVascularDiseaseDetection

*In this repository we are trying to predict Cardiovascular disease (CVD) using patients data in 12 features, such as age, gender, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, and etc. This has raised many concerns and research to find ways to prevent CVD among people. While it is said that up to 90% of CVD may be preventable, it is difficult to predict and prevent this disease because it involves many risk factors such as sex, family history, smoking and many more. Data analysis and machine learning methods seem to be a reliable way to explore the patients’ data, identify risk factors, and predict if a person is likely to have CVD or not.*

### Key facts
CVDs are the number 1 cause of death globally: more people die annually from CVDs than from any other cause.
An estimated 17.9 million people died from CVDs in 2016, representing 31% of all global deaths. Of these deaths, 85% are due to heart attack and stroke.
Over three quarters of CVD deaths take place in low- and middle-income countries.
Out of the 17 million premature deaths (under the age of 70) due to noncommunicable diseases in 2015, 82% are in low- and middle-income countries, and 37% are caused by CVDs.
Most cardiovascular diseases can be prevented by addressing behavioural risk factors such as tobacco use, unhealthy diet and obesity, physical inactivity and harmful use of alcohol using population-wide strategies.
People with cardiovascular disease or who are at high cardiovascular risk (due to the presence of one or more risk factors such as hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidaemia or already established disease) need early detection and management using counselling and medicines, as appropriate.

### What are cardiovascular diseases?
Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are a group of disorders of the heart and blood vessels and they include:

coronary heart disease – disease of the blood vessels supplying the heart muscle;

cerebrovascular disease – disease of the blood vessels supplying the brain;

peripheral arterial disease – disease of blood vessels supplying the arms and legs;

rheumatic heart disease – damage to the heart muscle and heart valves from rheumatic fever, caused by streptococcal bacteria;

congenital heart disease – malformations of heart structure existing at birth;

deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism – blood clots in the leg veins, which can dislodge and move to the heart and lungs.

Heart attacks and strokes are usually acute events and are mainly caused by a blockage that prevents blood from flowing to the heart or brain. The most common reason for this is a build-up of fatty deposits on the inner walls of the blood vessels that supply the heart or brain. Strokes can also be caused by bleeding from a blood vessel in the brain or from blood clots. The cause of heart attacks and strokes are usually the presence of a combination of risk factors, such as tobacco use, unhealthy diet and obesity, physical inactivity and harmful use of alcohol, hypertension, diabetes and hyperlipidaemia.
